1. Stateless Components

    Stateless components are components that do not manage any state internally.
    They rely solely on the props passed to them for rendering data or behavior.

2. Statefull Components

    Stateful components are components that manage their own state.
    They use React hooks like useState or useReducer (or class-based state in older React).

3. Reconciliation

    Reconciliation is React’s smart way of updating the user interface efficiently. 
    By comparing the old and new virtual DOM, React minimizes changes to the real DOM, 
    resulting in faster performance and a smoother user experience.

4. Virtual DOM

    The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation (or copy) of the actual DOM (Document Object Model) used in browsers.
    React uses this virtual DOM to make updates to the UI faster and more efficient. 
    "virtual DOM tree" which is a JavaScript object representing the real DOM
    At first the DOM elements will get rendered and then the change in state will update virtual DOM and it will update real DOM

5. Controlled components

    A controlled component is a form element (like <input>, <textarea>, <select>) whose value is controlled by React state.

    function ControlledComponent() {
    const [name, setName] = useState("");

    const handleChange = (e) => {
        setName(e.target.value); // Update the state with input's value
    };

    return (
        <div>
        <label>Name: </label>
        <input 
            type="text" 
            value={name} // Controlled by state
            onChange={handleChange} // Updates state on change
        />
        <p>Your name: {name}</p>
        </div>
    );
    }

6.  UnControlled components

    An uncontrolled component is a form element that manages its own state internally.
    React does not control the value of the input; instead, the DOM itself handles the input value.

    function UncontrolledComponent() {
    const inputRef = useRef(null);

    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert("Input Value: " + inputRef.current.value);
    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <label>Name: </label>
        <input 
            type="text" 
            ref={inputRef} // Ref to access input's value
        />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    );
    }

7. UseCallback:

    useCallback is used to memoize a function so that it retains the same reference across renders unless its dependencies change.
    Passing functions as props or passing inside useeffect dependency can cause child components and component to re-render unnecessarily.
    So we memoize the function untill it dependency changes

8. UseMemo:

    useMemo is used to memoize the result of a computation and only recompute it when its dependencies change.So we dont have to 
    repeat the computation whenever the component re-renders

9. What is a Higher-Order Component (HOC) in React?

    A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a React component as its input and returns a new component.
    It allows you to reuse component logic across multiple components by wrapping them in the HOC.

10. Pure vs Impure components

    Pure Function Components: Only re-render when props or state change. Optimized with React.memo.

    import React, { memo } from 'react';

    const PureComponent = memo(({ name }) => {
    console.log('PureComponent Rendered');
    return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
    });

    export default function App() {
    return <PureComponent name="Alice" />;
    }

    Impure Function Components: Re-render whenever the parent re-renders, regardless of prop or state changes.

    import React, { memo } from 'react';

    const PureComponent = memo(({ name }) => {
    console.log('PureComponent Rendered');
    return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
    });

    function App() {
    return <PureComponent name="Alice" />;
    }

11. Virtual DOM vs Real DOM

    Real DOM is the actual UI representation that browsers use, but it is slow and inefficient for frequent updates.

    Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the Real DOM in memory, and React uses it to optimize performance by reducing
    the number of updates to the Real DOM.
    A virtual DOM is typically represented as a tree-like data structure, consisting of nested JavaScript objects called 
    "vnodes" (virtual nodes)

12. Why react is faster than vanilla js.

    Virtual DOM: React uses a lightweight in-memory copy of the DOM, allowing for more efficient updates.
    Batching Updates: React groups multiple updates together to reduce the number of reflows/repaints in the browser.
    Reconciliation: React minimizes the number of DOM updates by calculating the minimal number of changes needed.
    Declarative UI: React’s declarative syntax allows for more predictable and efficient UI updates.
    Component Re-rendering Optimization: React ensures that only components that need updating are re-rendered, improving performance.
    Efficient List Handling: React optimizes list rendering and updates by using keys for better reconciliation.

13. how will you structure a component when it is recursively called?

    Recursively called components are useful for rendering hierarchical or nested data structures in a clean, maintainable way.
    The key aspects to manage include:

    import React from 'react';

    const Menu = ({ items }) => {
    if (!items || items.length === 0) return null;

    return (
        <ul>
        {items.map((item, index) => (
            <li key={index}>
            <a href={item.link}>{item.name}</a>

            {/* If the item has a submenu, render the submenu recursively */}
            {item.submenu && item.submenu.length > 0 && (
                <Menu items={item.submenu} />
            )}
            </li>
        ))}
        </ul>
    );
    };

    const App = () => {
    const menuItems = [
        {
        name: 'Home',
        link: '/home',
        },
        {
        name: 'About',
        link: '/about',
        submenu: [
            { name: 'Team', link: '/about/team' },
            { name: 'Company', link: '/about/company' },
        ],
        },
        {
        name: 'Contact',
        link: '/contact',
        },
    ];

    return (
        <div>
        <h1>Recursive Menu</h1>
        <Menu items={menuItems} />
        </div>
    );
    };

    export default App;
