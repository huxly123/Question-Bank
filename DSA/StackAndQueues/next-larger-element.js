// Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element in given Array

// Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 2, 4]
// Output: [3, 4, 4, -1]
// Explanation: The next larger element to 1 is 3, 3 is 4, 2 is 4 and for 4, since it doesn’t exist, it is -1.

// Input: arr[] = [6, 8, 0, 1, 3]
// Output: [8, -1, 1, 3, -1]
// Explanation: The next larger element to 6 is 8, for 8 there is no larger elements hence it is -1, for 0 it is 1 , for 1 it is 3 and then for 3 there is no larger element on right and hence -1.

// Input: arr[] = [50, 40, 30, 10]
// Output: [-1, -1, -1, -1]
// Explanation: There is no greater element for any of the elements in the array, so all are -1.
